# What is Excavator?

Excavator is a web application that uses small modular data miners to report information from the U.S. Federal Government.
All reported data is available to the public. Excavator merely exposes a nicer front end for journalists and activists
while supplying a nice extensible back end for developers to add more sources of data.
